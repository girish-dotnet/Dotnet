  4) A constructor can be overloaded. 

Types of constructors : 
_________________________

 1) static constructors : These are called class constructors, which are used to initilize the static variables of the class, These constructors are invoked automatically before the control reaches the entry point. These constructors cannot be overloaded. 

 2) instance constructors : These are the constructors that which are invoked automatically once the instance of the class created. These constructors can be overloaded. 

Destructors : Used to deallocated memory, which allocated by constructors and prefixed with (~) symbol.
